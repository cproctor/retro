Agent
=====

You will customize your game by defining Agents and adding them to the game. 
In an adventure game, one agent might represent the player, 
others might represent enemies, loot, or walls.
You don't need to use the Agent class; you need to write your own class
which has some of the same attributes and methods as Agent.
