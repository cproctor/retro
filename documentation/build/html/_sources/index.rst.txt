Retro Games
=======================================

Before graphical user interfaces (GUIs),
computer input and output all happened through
the Terminal.
The first computer games were Terminal-based, taking 
input from the keyboard and using the Terminal's array
of characters as a board.
The rigid constraints of this environment led to great 
creativity. 

Retro is a framework for creating Terminal-based games, 
intended for use by students learning the basics of 
Object-Oriented Programming.
